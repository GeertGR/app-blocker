AppBlocker for Google Ads - Instructions
=======================================

What does this extension do?
----------------------------
AppBlocker for Google Ads allows you to quickly exclude all app categories in Google Ads with a single click. This is especially useful when you want to prevent your ads from appearing in mobile apps or games, saving you time and effort compared to manually unchecking each category.

How to install
--------------
1. Download or clone the extension files to a folder on your computer.
2. Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable 'Developer mode' (top right corner).
4. Click 'Load unpacked' and select the folder containing the extension files.
5. The extension will now appear in your Chrome toolbar.

How to use
----------
1. Go to your Google Ads campaign where you can exclude app categories (e.g., in the placement exclusions section).
2. Click the AppBlocker for Google Ads icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup.
3. Click 'Select All Checkboxes' to select all app categories for exclusion.
4. (Optional) Click 'Deselect All Checkboxes' if you want to clear all selections.
5. Continue with your Google Ads workflow as usual.

Notes
-----
- The extension works on all pages with checkboxes, but is optimized for the Google Ads interface.
- Custom checkboxes (such as Material Design checkboxes) are also supported.
- No data is collected or sent anywhere; all actions happen locally in your browser.
- IMPORTANT: If the list of app categories is long, you may need to scroll down to load all checkboxes before using the extension. Only visible (loaded) checkboxes can be selected.
